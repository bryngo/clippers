# Clippers
- Automatically merge clips from your channel to produce a public + static mp4 file. (Great for using as an intro reel in OBS)

## TODO
- Get a domain   


## Known Issues
- Merging clips of different framerates / resolutions does not produce expected outputs
    - This is most common in shared channels.
